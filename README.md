### FAQ
* How do I add a youtuber? First you go to cyxl.org/stracker/youtube and then you go to the bottom and find the bar that says add a youtuber.
* A tried to add a youtuber but it didnt work, what should I do? First check if your youtuber you are trying to track meets the [requirements](requirements.md), then if it still dosnt work ping cyxl# in the TechWithTim discord and I will manualy add it. This should never happen.
